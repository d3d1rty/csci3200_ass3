This project is an assignment for CSCI 3200 (XML Processing) course at APSU. Being this is an educational project for a grade, collaboration isn't exactly the goal here. But if you feel that you can benefit from perusing my code, go for it! 

Please, just keep in mind that academic dishonesty is probably (definitely) not tolerated by your educational institution, so come up with your own solutions. Besides, I sincerely doubt that your assignment has the same requirements as mine, so you will probably look like an idiot if you try to turn this in.

If you have any questions regarding this project, send me a message and I'd be more than happy to explain my code.

In this particular project, I've used the Xerces library provided by Apache. Refer to that project website for license information. All non-Xerces code is mine.
